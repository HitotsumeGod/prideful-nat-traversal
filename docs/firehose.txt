Prideful NAT Traversal: Firehose Strategy
Peter Naylor
October 5, 2025

Basically we have each peer constantly ping each port on each other's NAT device
(typically a standard home router), which in theory should establish stateful
firewall rules for every possible ip:port pairing from peer to peer; if the
peers routinely send packets such that more packets are sent to each port before
the rules expire, a packet will eventually make it through. Upon this happening,
the recipient peer will immediately stop spraying their firehose, and instead
note its peer's ip:port pair, received via the packet, and begin directing
traffic to that port. Even sooner, a packet will be received by that peer, which
will perform the same process with its peer, until both peers have exchanged an
ACK packet with one another, confirming the connection. From here, NAT traversal
has been performed; communication is now possible.
