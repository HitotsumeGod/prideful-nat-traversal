Establishing a PNT connection is performed as follows:
1. pnt_traverse() establishes SPI rules for every possible ip:port combination
with peer_ip as the IP. This is done by sending arbitrary data to every possible
ip:port combination such as 
peer_ip:1024
peer_ip:1025
peer_ip:1026
etc. When our SPI-enabled NATdev sees such messages being sent out, it
unquestioningly creates an SPI rule for each one that looks something like this:
ALLOW IN peer_ip:dest_port
Once the data is through the firewall, it will be forwarded by the NAT like
usual. 
2a. Both peers ought be performing step 1 in relative tandem. When a message gets
through to a peer (which will always be the peer that started first, since it
will have established an SPI rule for its ip:port address before its peer sends
a message to that ip:port address), if it is a 'hi' message, our host will immediately 
exit the loop and send an ACK message to its peer with the latter's exact ip:port 
address now being recorded.
2aa. We will now wait for an ACK from the peer we ACK'd earlier. Once this ACk
is received, the connection has been established.
2b. If the message received is an ACK, we will send out another ACK to our peer,
and treat the connection as being established.
